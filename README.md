# 🎞️ GIF Creator using Python 🐍

This project allows you to create animated GIFs from multiple image files using Python. It's a simple tool built with beginner-friendly libraries like Pillow and ImageIO, and it runs easily on your local machine (MacBook or any system with Python).

## 📁 Project Structure

```

gif-creator/
├── create\_gif.py     # Main script to generate GIF from images
├── gif\_images/       # Folder containing your input images (JPG, PNG)
└── animated.gif      # Output GIF generated by the script

````

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Place your image files inside the `gif_images/` folder.
2. Run the `create_gif.py` script.
3. All images are resized to the same dimensions.
4. The script creates and saves a GIF as `animated.gif` in the same folder.

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- Python 🐍
- [Pillow (PIL)](https://python-pillow.org/)
- [imageio](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/)

---

## 🔧 How to Run

### 1. Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install pillow imageio
````

### 2. Run the Script

```bash
python create_gif.py
```

### 3. Output

Your animated GIF will be saved as `animated.gif` in the project directory.

---

## 🧪 Sample Usage

Place at least 2–3 images inside `gif_images/`, like:

```
img1.jpg
img2.png
img3.jpg
```

Then run the script and your GIF will be created!

## 📌 Notes

* All input images must be resized to the same size — the script handles this automatically.
* At least **2 images** are required to generate a GIF.

## 💡 Future Ideas

* Add text or watermarks to each frame
* Convert videos into GIFs
* Web interface using Flask
